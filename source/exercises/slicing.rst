Goal
====

Get the basics of sequence slicing down.

Tasks
-----

Write some functions that take a sequence as an argument, and return a copy of that sequence:

* with the first and last items exchanged.
* with every other item removed.
* with the first 4 and the last 4 items removed, and then every other item in the remaining sequence.
* with the elements reversed (just with slicing).
* with the last third, then first third, then the middle third in the new order.

  - Example:   ``(1,2,3,4,5,6)`` should return: ``(5,6,1,2,3,4)`` (start with a length that's a multiple of three, but make sure it doesn't crash for other lengths)

**NOTE:** These should work with ANY sequence -- but you can use strings to test, if you like.

Your functions should look like:

.. code-block:: python

  def exchange_first_last(seq):
      return a_new_sequence


**Hint:**

Your functions should work with ALL sequences. That means that you cannot use list methods, like ``.append``, because that won't work with strings and tuples. But all sequences support concatenation with the ``+`` operator.

Item or Sequence?
.................

A key difference between using a single index: ``seq[i]`` and using a slice: ``seq[i:j], seq[:i], seq[i:]`` is that using an index returns a single item, whereas a slice always returns a sequence -- even if that sequence is of length one or even empty. And concatenation requires a sequence, so make sure you use slicing if you want to concatenate the results.

.. note:: Python "gotcha" with strings. Python does not have a character type. Instead of a character, you get a length-one string. This can cause confusion sometimes, as other sequences return a single item when you index, so when you index into a list of numbers, you get number -- which is not a list (or any type of sequence). But with strings, when you index into (or loop through) a string, you get a length-one string, which is, itself a string, and therefor a valid sequence. So: ``a_string[i] + another_string`` works, but ``a_list[i] + another_list`` does not work.



Tests:
------

.. code-block:: python

    a_string = "this is a string"
    a_tuple = (2, 54, 13, 12, 5, 32)

    assert exchange_first_last(a_string) == "ghis is a strint"
    assert exchange_first_last(a_tuple) == (32, 54, 13, 12, 5, 2)

Write a test or two like that for each of the above functions.
