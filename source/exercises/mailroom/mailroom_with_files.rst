Mailroom With Files
###################

**Incorporate file writing.**


Goal
====

Write a full set of letters to all donors to individual files on disk.

In the first version of mailroom, you generated a letter to a donor who had just made a new donation, and printed it to the screen.

In this version of your program, add a function, and a menu item to invoke it, that goes through all the donors in your donor data structure, generates a thank you letter for each donor, and writes each letter to disk as a text file.

Your main menu may look something like::

    Choose an action:

    1 - Send a Thank You to a single donor.
    2 - Create a Report.
    3 - Send letters to all donors.
    4 - Quit

The letters should each get a unique file name. You can keep it really simple and just use the donor's name or add a date timestamp for additional uniqueness.

You want to avoid specifying a hardcoded file path when creating the files. For example, don't to this:

.. code-block:: python

    open("/home/users/bob/dev/mailroom/thank_you.txt", "w")

Doing so will prevent other users from running the program as it will fail to find your path. Instead, you can create files in the current working directory or you can use a temporary directory.

To identify a temporary directory you can use a handy function like ``tempfile.gettempdir()``. It also happens to be OS agnostic. That means that it can handle temp directory differences between different operating systems.

See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.gettempdir

After running the "send letters to everyone" option, you should see some new files in the directory. There should be a file for each donor in the database, in this case 4.

After choosing action (3) above, using my example database, I get these files::

    Jeff_Bezos.txt
    Mark_Zuckerberg.txt
    Paul_Allen.txt
    William_Gates_III.txt

If you want to get really fancy, ask the user for a directory name to write to!

An example file content looks like this::

    Dear Jeff Bezos,

          Thank you for your very kind donation of $877.33.

          It will be put to very good use.

                         Sincerely,
                            -The Team

Feel free to enhance your letter template with some more information about past generosity, etc.

The idea is to require you to structure your code so that you can write the same letter to the screen or to disk (and thus anywhere else) and also exercise a bit of file writing. Remember to review the `with <http://www.diveintopython3.net/files.html#with>`_ statement as it is the preferred method when working with files.
