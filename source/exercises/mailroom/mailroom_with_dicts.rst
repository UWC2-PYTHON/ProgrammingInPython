Mailroom With Dicts

**Incorporate dictionary use.**

Use dicts Where Appropriate
===========================

The first version of this assignment used these basic data types: numbers, strings, lists and tuples.

However, using dictionaries, an important built in data structure in Python, will let you re-write your program a bit more simply and efficiently.

Update your mailroom program to:

- Convert your main donor data structure to be a dict. Think about an appropriate key for easy donor look up.

- Use dicts anywhere else, as appropriate.

- Use a dict to switch between the users selections. See :ref:`dict_as_switch` for what this means.

- Use a dict and the ``.format()`` method to produce the letter as one big template, rather than building up a big string that produces the letter in parts.

Example:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [3]: d
    Out[3]: {'first_name': 'Chris', 'last_name': 'Barker'}

    In [5]: "My name is {first_name} {last_name}".format(**d)
    Out[5]: 'My name is Chris Barker'

Don't worry too much about the ``**``. We'll get into the details later, but for now it means, more or less, "pass this whole dict in as a bunch of keyword arguments."
