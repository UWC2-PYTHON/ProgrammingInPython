File Exercise

Goal
====

Get a little bit of practice with handling files and parsing simple text.

Paths and File Processing
=========================

Write a program which prints the full path for all files in the current directory, one per line. Use either the ``os`` module or ``pathlib``.

Write a program which copies a file from a source, to a destination without using ``shutil``, or the OS copy command. You are essentially writing a simple version of the OS copy command.

- This should work for any kind of file, so you need to open the files in binary mode: ``open(filename, 'rb')`` or ``'wb'`` for writing. Note that for binary files you can't use ``readline()``. Lines don't have any meaning for binary files.
- Test it with both text and binary files. Maybe a jpeg or something of your choosing.
- Advanced: make it work for any size file: i.e. don't read the entire contents of the file into memory at once.
- This should only be a few lines of code.
