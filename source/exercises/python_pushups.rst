These are a quick exercise to kick you off with Python.

==============

* Create a new directory in your working dir for the class::

    $ mkdir pushups
    $ cd pushups

* Add a new file to it called ``break_me.py``

* In the ``break_me.py`` file write four simple Python functions:

    * Each function, when called, should cause an exception to happen.

    * Each function should result in one of the four most common exceptions you'll find.

    * For review:

        - ``NameError``
        - ``TypeError``
        - ``SyntaxError``
        - ``AttributeError``

Hint: the interpreter will quit when it hits a Exception so you can comment out all but the one you are testing at the moment.

Use the Python standard library reference on `Built In Exceptions <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html>`_ as a reference.
