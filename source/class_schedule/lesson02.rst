Python Tutorial
...............

Tutorials come in many forms, but I define a python "tutorial" as a quick high-level introduction, designed to kick start your python programming. It should give you enough to get something done, but not provide a lot of detailed explanations. If you have been doing a bit of python coding already, or have taken an introductory programming class with Python, then you may be able to skip this step.

Every one of you has a different background and learning style. So take a bit of time to figure out which resource works for you.

:ref:`python_learning_resources`

Provides some options. Do look it over.

Python Basics
-------------

If you are comfortable with the materials in a tutorial, it's time for some more in-depth discussion. Here are a few options to get you started this week:

Finish Reading: :ref:`basic_python_syntax`

Read: :ref:`more_on_functions`

Read: :ref:`documentation`

Supplemental Reading
--------------------

If that is too fast, then here are some good options for another look:

* Think Python -- Chapters 1 to 6

    - https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-3rd-edition/

* Dive Into Python -- Chapters 0 to 2

    - http://www.diveintopython3.net/

* Learn Python the Hard Way -- Chapters 1 to 10 and 18 to 21

    - https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/

.. note:: *Learn Python the Hard Way* used to be totally free. Now it looks like you may only get a sneak peak -- darn! -- but the first few "chapters" are available.

Goal
----

You should be comfortable with working with variables, numbers, strings, and basic functions before the next class.

Git
---

We are only using a small subset of git functionality for this class, but if you feel lost, and/or want to know more, these are some good resources:
