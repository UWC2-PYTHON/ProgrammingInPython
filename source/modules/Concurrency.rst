Concurrent Programming
######################

What does it mean to do something "concurrently"? It means multiple things are happening at the same time. But what are those "things"?

- Parallelism is about processing multiple things at the same time -- true parallelism requires multiple processors (or cores).
- Concurrency is about handling multiple things at the same time -- which may or may not be actually running in the processor at the same time (like network requests for instance).
- Parallelism needs concurrency, but concurrency need not be in parallel.

Whirlwind Tour of Concurrency
=============================

Concurrency:
  Having different code running at the same time, or kind of at the same time.

Asynchrony:
  The occurrence of events independent of the main program flow and ways to deal with such events.

Asynchrony and Concurrency are really two different things -- you can do either one without the other -- but they are closely related, and often used together. They solve different problems, but the problems and the solutions overlap.

"Concurrency is not parallelism" -- Rob Pike:  https://vimeo.com/49718712

Despite Rob Pike using an example about burning books, I recommend listening to at least the first half of his talk.

In that talk Rob Pike makes a key point: Breaking down tasks into concurrent subtasks only allows parallelism, itâ€™s the scheduling of these subtasks that creates it.

And, indeed, once you have a set of subtasks, they can be scheduled in a truly parallel fashion, or managed asynchronously in a single thread (concurrent, but not parallel)


Types of Concurrency
--------------------

Multithreading:
  Multiple code paths sharing memory -- one Python interpreter, one set of Python objects.

Multiprocessing:
  Multiple code paths with separate memory space -- completely separate Python interpreter.

Asynchronous programming:
  Multiple "jobs" run at "arbitrary" times -- but usually in one thread -- i.e. only one code path, one interpreter.

Lots of different packages for both in the standard library and 3rd party libraries.

How to know what to choose?

- IO bound vs. CPU bound -- CPU bound requires multiprocessing (at least with pure Python)
- Event driven cooperative multitasking vs. preemptive multitasking
- Callbacks vs coroutines + scheduler/event loop

Motivations for Parallel Execution
----------------------------------

-  Performance
   -  Limited by "Amdahl's Law": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law
   -  CPUs aren't getting much faster

-  Event handling
   - If a system handles asynchronous events, a separate thread of execution could handle those events and let other threads do other work

   - Examples:
      -  Network applications
      -  User interfaces

Parallel programming can be hard!

If your problem can be solved sequentially, consider the costs and benefits before going parallel.

Parallelization Strategy for Performance
----------------------------------------

1. Break problem down into chunks
2. Execute chunks in parallel
3. Reassemble output of chunks into result

-  Not every problem can be parallelized.
-  There is an optimal number of threads for each problem in each environment, so make it tunable.
-  Working concurrently opens up synchronization issues.
-  Methods for synchronizing threads:
   -  locks
   -  queues
   -  signaling/messaging mechanisms

Other Options
-------------

Traditionally, concurrency has been achieved through multiple process communication and in-process threads, as we've seen.

Another strategy is through micro-threads, implemented via coroutines and a scheduler.

A coroutine is a generalization of a subroutine which allows multiple entry points for suspending and resuming execution.

The threading and the multiprocessing modules follow a `preemptive multitasking model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)>`_.

Coroutine based solutions follow a `cooperative multitasking model: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking#Cooperative_multitasking.2Ftime-sharing>`_.

Threads Versus Processes in Python
----------------------------------

Threads are lightweight processes_ that run in the address space of an OS process. In Python these are true OS level threads. Therefore, they are a component of a process.

.. _processes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-weight_process

This allows multiple threads access to data in the same scope.

Threads cannot gain the performance advantage of multiple processors due to the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

But the GIL is released during IO, allowing IO bound processes to benefit from threading.

Processes
---------

A process contains all the instructions and data required to execute independently, so processes do not share data!

Multiple processes are the best strategy to speed up CPU bound operations.

However, the Python interpreter isn't lightweight.

Communication between processes can be achieved via:

* ``multiprocessing.Queue``
* ``multiprocessing.Pipe``

And, of course, regular IPC (inter-process communication) channels.

Data to be moved between processes must be pickleable.

Advantages / Disadvantages of Threads
-------------------------------------

Advantages
..........

They share memory space:

- Threads are relatively lightweight. Shared memory means they can be created fairly quickly without much memory use.
- Easy and cheap to pass data around as you are only passing a reference.

Disadvantages
.............

They share memory space:

- Each thread is working with the *same* python objects.
- Operations often take several steps and may be interrupted mid-stream.
- Thus, access to shared data is also non-deterministic.
- You can easily have race conditions appear in your code.

Creating threads is easy, but programming with threads is difficult.

GIL
---

**Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**

This is a lock which must be obtained by each thread before it can execute, ensuring thread safety.

.. image:: /_static/gil.png

The GIL is released during IO operations, so threads which spend time waiting on network or disk access can enjoy performance gains.

The GIL is not unlike multitasking in humans, some things can truly be done in parallel, others have to be done by time slicing.

Note that potentially blocking or long-running operations, such as I/O, image processing, and NumPy number crunching, happen outside the GIL. Therefore it is only in multithreaded programs that spend a lot of time inside the GIL, interpreting CPython bytecode, that the GIL becomes a bottleneck. But: it can still cause performance degradation.

Not only will threads not help CPU-bound problems, but it can actually make things *worse*, especially on multi-core machines!

Python threads do not work well for computationally intensive work.

Python threads work well if the threads are spending time waiting for something:

- Database Access
- Network Access
- File I/O

Python 3.13 has an experimental build that does not have the GIL but support for it is only just beginning to form.

Advantages / Disadvantages of Processes
---------------------------------------

Processes are heavier weight. Each process makes a copy of the entire interpreter and uses more resources.

You need to copy the data you need back and forth between processes.

They're slower to start, slower to use, and use more memory.

But as the entire python process is copied, each subprocess is working with the different objects -- they can't step on each other.

Multiprocessing is suitable for computationally intensive work.

It works best for "large" problems with not much data to pass back and forth, as that's what's expensive.

Note that there are ways to share memory between processes, if you have a lot of read-only data that needs to be used. See: `memory maps <https://docs.python.org/3/library/mmap.html>`_.

These are your options for synchronization:

- Locks (Mutex: mutual exclusion, Rlock: reentrant lock)
- Semaphore
- BoundedSemaphore
- Event
- Condition
- Queues

Mutex Locks (``threading.Lock``)
--------------------------------

- Probably most common
- Only one thread can modify shared data at any given time
- Thread determines when unlocked
- Must put lock/unlock around critical code in ALL threads
- Difficult to manage

These are easiest with a context manager:

.. code-block:: python

    x = 0
    x_lock = threading.Lock()

    # Example critical section
    with x_lock:
        # statements using x

You should only ever create one lock per thread! Any more and you risk mysterious deadlocks.

Alternatively, you can use RLock for code-based locking and create locks based function/method execution rather than data access.

Subprocesses (``subprocess``)
-----------------------------

Subprocesses are completely separate processes invoked from a main process, i.e. your python program.

They are usually used to call non-Python programs -- aka shell commands. But of course, a Python program can be a command line program as well, so you can call either your program or other Python programs this way.

For easy invocation:

.. code-block:: python

    import subprocess

    subprocess.run('ls')

The program halts while waiting for the subprocess to finish, unless you call it from a thread!

You can control communication with the subprocess via:

``stdout``, ``stdin``, ``stderr`` with:

``subprocess.Popen``

Lots of options there!

Pipes and ``pickle`` and ``subprocess``
.......................................

- Very low level, for the brave of heart
- Can send just about any Python object

For this to work, you need to send messages, as each process runs its own independent Python interpreter.
