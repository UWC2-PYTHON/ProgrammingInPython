Useful Python Learning Resources
================================

In addition to the material we cover in class, there are numerous online resources to help a newcomer get to know Python. The following list represents the best-known and best-regarded of the breed. If you are itching for a bit more work on your Python chops, you should try these out.

Python Language Resources
==========================

As a Python programmer, you'll want to keep a bookmark pointed at the official `Python documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/>`_, especially `the documentation for the standard library <https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html>`_. However, there are a number of additional resources you can (and should) use to help build your Python skills.

For the Beginner
----------------

Getting Started Tutorials
.........................

* `Jessica McKeller's Beginning Tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MirG-vJOg04>`_ - This video is getting a little bit old but is still quite good.

* `The Python Tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_ - This is the official tutorial from the Python website. No more authoritative source is available.

* `Code Academy Python Track <http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python>`_ - Often cited as a great resource, this site offers an entertaining and engaging approach and in-browser work.

* `Learn Python the Hard Way <https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/>`_ - Solid and gradual. This course offers a great foundation for folks who have never programmed in any language before.

Complete Books / Series
.......................

* `Dive Into Python 3 <https://diveintopython3.net/>`_ - The updated version of a classic. This book offers an introduction to Python aimed at the student who has experience programming in another language. It used to be available free online -- you can still find PDF copies on the web.

* `Python for You and Me <https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ - Simple and clear. This is a great book for absolute newcomers, or to keep as a quick reference as you get used to the language.

* `Think Python <https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-3rd-edition/>`_ - Methodical and complete.  This book offers a very "computer science-style" introduction to Python. It is really an intro to Python *in the service of* Computer Science, though, so while helpful for the absolute newcomer, it isn't quite as "pythonic" as it might be.

* `Python 101 <https://leanpub.com/py101>`_ - Available as a reasonably priced ebook. This is a new one from a popular blogger about Python. Lots of practical examples. Also available as a Kindle book: http://www.amazon.com/Python-101-Michael-Driscoll-ebook/dp/B00KQTFHNK

Advanced Books
..............

* `The Modern Python Cookbook <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/modern-python-cookbook/9781835466384/>`_ - The Modern Python Cookbook provides practical solutions to various programming tasks, along with excellent explanations of how they work.

* `Fluent Python <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python/9781491946237/>`_ - Fluent Python is an excellent deeper dive into the inner workings of Python. Written for folks that already understand the basics of Python, it goes provides explanations of the more advanced topics in Python. If we were going to use a textbook for an advanced Python class, this would be it.
